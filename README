BEAVER, short for "Better Evaluate A Very Efficient Rational" is a special function library for fast and robust evaluation of logarithms, polylogarithms and similar functions appearing in high energy physics codes.
Implementation is in C++ in double precission as header-only files.
Functions implemented so far are:

- the inverse tangent arctan(x) as beaver::atan(x)
- the inverse tangent integral, Ti_2(x) as beaver::atanint(x)
- the dilogarithm Li_2(x) as beaver::dilog(x)
- the (natural) logarithm ln(x) as beaver::log(x)
- the (natural) logarithm (for argument near 1) ln(1+x) as beaver::log1p(x)
- the power x^n as beaver::pow(x,n) (for integer n)
- the single-valued dilogarithm L_2(x) as beaver::svdilog(x)
- the trilogarithm Li3_3(x) as beaver::trilog(x)

To use all beaver functions include the header in your C++ code as
#include "beaver.hpp"
