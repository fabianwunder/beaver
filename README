# BEAVER

**BEAVER** — *Better Evaluate A Very Efficient Rational* — is a special function library for **fast and robust evaluation** of logarithms, polylogarithms, and related functions appearing in high-energy physics codes.  

The library is implemented in **C++**, double precision, as **header-only** files for easy integration into your projects.  
See [Citation](#citation) for how to reference BEAVER in scientific work.

## Implemented functions

- Inverse tangent: `beaver::atan(x)`
- Inverse tangent integral *Ti₂(x)*: `beaver::atanint(x)`
- Dilogarithm *Li₂(x)*: `beaver::dilog(x)`
- Natural logarithm *ln(x)*: `beaver::log(x)`
- Natural logarithm near unity *ln(1+x)*: `beaver::log1p(x)`
- Power *xⁿ* (integer exponent): `beaver::pow(x, n)`
- Single-valued dilogarithm *L₂(x)*: `beaver::svdilog(x)`
- Trilogarithm *Li₃(x)*: `beaver::trilog(x)`
